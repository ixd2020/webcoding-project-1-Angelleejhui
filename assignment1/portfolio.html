While he meticulously details every aspect of his creations, from the lights and shadows of a character’s flesh to the flowers and butterflies that protrude from its mouth, he leaves a signature white space where the eyes should have been. This applies to many of his works involving herbalists. Many have heard that the eyes are a gateway to the soul, a determinant of one’s identity. To draw the eyes right, to breathe life into them on a two dimensional surface is every artist’s struggle. Yet, to completely void a face of eyes at all is a message in itself.

Using the same symbolism of flowers and butterflies as Mazzoni uses in many of his works, I created a headpiece and mask that enveloped my entire face, as to create a level of mental and physical suffocation. I was uncomfortable, bare and vulnerable. I needed to get too deep into my own head that it made me paranoid and slightly crazed. And these are the results:</p>
